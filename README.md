# Customer Churn Analytics Data Pipeline

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Analytics Data Pipeline** project! This extensive data engineering initiative utilizes Python-based ETL processes and incorporates Apache Airflow along with AWS services like Glue, S3, and Redshift, creating a complete solution for analyzing customer churn. Additionally, the project integrates PowerBI to provide insightful visualizations.

## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on building and automating a reliable ETL pipeline. The pipeline comprises the following core components:

### Apache Airflow:
- An open-source platform used for scheduling and orchestrating tasks. It automates workflows to ensure smooth execution.

### AWS Glue:
- Utilizes Glue Crawlers to detect schemas within data stored in an AWS S3 bucket. This allows us to build a comprehensive data catalog and load data efficiently into Amazon Redshift.

### AWS S3:
- The data source where raw customer churn data is stored and ready to be processed.

### Amazon Redshift:
- Serves as the central data warehouse where transformed data is stored and managed.

### PowerBI:
- A powerful visualization tool that connects to the Redshift cluster, enabling dynamic and interactive visual analysis of customer churn data.

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Data Extraction:
- AWS Glue Crawler scans the AWS S3 bucket to extract data.
- It automatically infers schemas and builds a data catalog for easier data management.

### 2. Data Transformation:
- Apache Airflow automates and orchestrates the ETL workflow.
- The raw data undergoes cleansing and transformation to prepare it for deeper analysis.

### 3. Data Loading:
- Processed data is loaded into Amazon Redshift, where it is stored and managed for further analysis.

### 4. Data Visualization:
- PowerBI connects directly to the Redshift data warehouse.
- It offers powerful visualizations, uncovering patterns and insights into customer churn behavior.

## Key Features of the Project

### AWS Cloud Platform:
- The entire pipeline runs on AWS, ensuring high scalability, reliability, and security.

### End-to-End Automation:
- Apache Airflow handles the orchestration and automation of the entire ETL process, streamlining the workflow.

### Comprehensive Data Analysis:
- Leverage Amazon Athena for writing SQL queries on the data catalog, enabling in-depth analysis of customer churn.

This project provides a robust, scalable framework for managing and analyzing customer churn data, driving insights that can inform business decisions and improve customer retention strategies.
